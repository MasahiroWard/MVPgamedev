MVP game development - Prismatic Chameleon 


Start the game. Select a stage (click to select). Press m on the keyboard to return to the menu at any time.  

To play, use the arrow keys to move and collect fruit. Press qweasd to change colors. 

Avoid enemies or kill enemies of the same color and get to the top of the stage. 

When stepping on colored tiles, make sure you are the same color as the tiles, otherwise you take damage. 

Please note that trial is a development stage and not meant for real gameplay.


Coding setup:
Each js file should look at a single object in the game
Player interacts with everything.  Thus, the functions for interactions should be defined in the interacted target.
Each stage should have boilerplate code that can be copy+pasted (such as player movement, fruit setup, enemy setup, etc.)
Stages should not have any code in them, they will simply call the relevant functions
Thus, we can change functions once to change game mechanics
